# Geolocation Search

Welcome to the Geolocation Search project! This application allows users to search for addresses or locations and receive results based on their search criteria and proximity to their location.

Additionally, this UI includes an upload button feature where users can upload a CSV file containing location data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/tejubhokare/geolocation-search-frontend.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```
   cd geolocation-search-frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```


## Environment Variables

The project uses environment variables to configure the backend API. By default, an `.env` file is included in the root of the project with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost
REACT_APP_API_PORT=3001
```

These variables specify the base URL and port of the backend API. If you encounter any port conflicts or need to change the configuration, you can modify these variables in the `.env` file accordingly.


## Testing

To run tests for the project, use the following command:

```
npm test
```
